I have researched quite a bit through many different sources regarding the topic and here is the thing that i infer from it.
There have been several past cases in which animals like dogs,elephants and frogs have somehow managed to predict some of the natural disaster hours or sometimes couple of days before the disaster which can again be very helpful even if we are able to save some of a few precious lives.
The major thing that scientists could infer from this was that the animals had a quite good sense of hearing infrasounds and specially dogs were had a good sense of touch which were able to sense the smallest of vibrations.
However there have been quite a few cases where animals do have failed to predict the disasters.
So instead of being in an uncertain state the uncertainty could be removed if were able to setup stations which could detect sudden changes in infra sound levels and with the help of machine learning we could be able to analyse that data in normal and disastrous cases.
Through many cases i think we or rather the computer would be able to understand the behaviour in cases of a disaster.
This would help us alot in taking care of disasters like earthquakes,tsunamis,avalanches,etc.
However here is a catch we need to counter.There are many other machines on ths planet which do generate infrasounds which ill have to research more about to solve it.
